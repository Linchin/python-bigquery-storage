        The response contains an optional offset at which the append

        The specifics of when successfully appended data is made visible
        to the table are governed by the type of stream:

        -  For COMMITTED streams (which includes the default stream),
           data is visible immediately upon successful append.

        -  For BUFFERED streams, data is made visible via a subsequent
           ``FlushRows`` rpc which advances a cursor to a newer offset
           in the stream.

        -  For PENDING streams, data is not made visible until the
           stream itself is finalized (via the ``FinalizeWriteStream``
           rpc), and the stream is explicitly committed via the
           ``BatchCommitWriteStreams`` rpc.
